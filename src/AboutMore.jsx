                <h5>RESPECT</h5>
                <small>
                  Respect for others is one of the basic requirements of
                  democratic life and the capacity to live in society. It
                  affects the individual and has both a social and a collective
                  dimension. Respect is a fundamental part of a sport, for sport
                  generates situations of tension that have to be resolved
                  almost instantaneously. There is, therefore, a need, above
                  rules and standards, for this value to be present in order to
                  guarantee cordial and correct interrelations between people.
                  In sport, respect is needed in similar situations to those
                  where it is demanded in wider society, but the intensity of
                  the moment implies that the presence or absence of respect can
                  be very obvious and can affect the development of the
                  situation or event.

                <h5>EFFORTS</h5>
                <small>
                  There are many social models that avoid effort and advocate
                  instead luck, opportunism, and immediate triumph. However, the
                  effort is a value that can take us to unthinkable heights and
                  lead us to achieve targets and objectives that may at other
                  times appear distant or inaccessible. Dedication, rigour,
                  constancy, sacrifice, and perseverance all bear fruit, while
                  luck and the search for a quick win are often fleeting and
                  momentary. Note that at school, teachers have for a long time
                  is promoting a culture of effort as the vehicle for academic
                  development and personal achievement, and this helps to
                  construct new social models.

                <h5>AMBITION</h5>
                <small>
                  Ambition is the desire to achieve the maximum performance and
                  do things not only well but also as well as is feasibly
                  possible and to improve every day. This value is applicable
                  both to individuals and to groups. It involves the use of a
                  web of values as varied as excellence, patience, discipline,
                  order, motivation, and responsibility. Indeed, ambition
                  invokes and requires a broad system of values and, in turn, is
                  related to a job being done well, effort and rigour. Regarding
                  targets, ambition is probably the surest way of achieving
                  them, for it is the impulse to grow.

                <h5>TEAMWORK</h5>
                <small>
                  Teamwork implies that the subject forms part of a group and
                  that, as a member of the same, becomes an active element that
                  acts on behalf of the whole (sometimes even to the determine
                  of their own individuality). There are undeniable benefits of
                  knowing that you are part of a team and this requires the
                  learning and accentuation of many other values.

                <h5>HUMILITY</h5>
                <small>
                  Often when athletes, and people in general, achieve the goals
                  they have set themselves, they start feeling superior in
                  physical, moral, economic and other terms, and this leads them
                  to forget certain values that have in all probability helped
                  them to achieve those very goals: effort, perseverance,
                  self-control, etc. We are all aware of how DCCA has dealt with
                  its victories of recent years, and how it has always shown
                  humility (and also such values as effort, rigour,
                  responsibility, and others) to win respect in its field, and
                  among its opponents, and generally everyone. Humility probably
                  consists of knowing how to be clear about oneâ€™s values, and to
                  maintain them and defend them even in situations where you are
                  clearly superior and more successful.
