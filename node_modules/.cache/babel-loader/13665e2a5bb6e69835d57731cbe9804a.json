It\r\n                  affects the individual and has both a social and a collective\r\n                  dimension. Respect is a fundamental part of a sport, for sport\r\n                  generates situations of tension that have to be resolved\r\n                  almost instantaneously. There is, therefore, a need, above\r\n                  rules and standards, for this value to be present in order to\r\n                  guarantee cordial and correct interrelations between people.\r\n                  In sport, respect is needed in similar situations to those\r\n                  where it is demanded in wider society, but the intensity of\r\n                  the moment implies that the presence or absence of respect can\r\n                  be very obvious and can affect the development of the\r\n                  situation or event.\r\n                </small>\r\n              </Fade>\r\n              <hr />\r\n              <Fade left>\r\n                <h5>EFFORTS</h5>\r\n                <small>\r\n                  There are many social models that avoid effort and advocate\r\n                  instead luck, opportunism, and immediate triumph. However, the\r\n                  effort is a value that can take us to unthinkable heights and\r\n                  lead us to achieve targets and objectives that may at other\r\n                  times appear distant or inaccessible. Dedication, rigour,\r\n                  constancy, sacrifice, and perseverance all bear fruit, while\r\n                  luck and the search for a quick win are often fleeting and\r\n                  momentary.

This value is applicable\r\n                  both to individuals and to groups. It involves the use of a\r\n                  web of values as varied as excellence, patience, discipline,\r\n                  order, motivation, and responsibility. Indeed, ambition\r\n                  invokes and requires a broad system of values and, in turn, is\r\n                  related to a job being done well, effort and rigour. Regarding\r\n                  targets, ambition is probably the surest way of achieving\r\n                  them, for it is the impulse to grow.\r\n                </small>\r\n              </Fade>\r\n              <hr />\r\n              <Fade left>\r\n                <h5>TEAMWORK</h5>\r\n                <small>\r\n                  Teamwork implies that the subject forms part of a group and\r\n                  that, as a member of the same, becomes an active element that\r\n                  acts on behalf of the whole (sometimes even to the determine\r\n                  of their own individuality). There are undeniable benefits of\r\n                  knowing that you are part of a team and this requires the\r\n                  learning and accentuation of many other values.\r\n                </small>\r\n              </Fade>\r\n              <hr />\r\n              <Fade left>\r\n                <h5>HUMILITY</h5>\r\n                <small>\r\n                  Often when athletes, and people in general, achieve the goals\r\n                  they have set themselves, they start feeling superior in\r\n                  physical, moral, economic and other terms, and this leads them\r\n                  to forget certain values that have in all probability helped\r\n                  them to achieve those very goals: effort, perseverance,\r\n                  self-control, etc. We are all aware of how DCCA has dealt with\r\n                  its victories of recent years, and how it has always shown\r\n                  humility (and also such values as effort, rigour,\r\n                  responsibility, and others) to win respect in its field, and\r\n                  among its opponents, and generally everyone. Humility probably\r\n                  consists of knowing how to be clear about one’s values, and to\r\n                  maintain them and defend them even in situations where you are\r\n                  clearly superior and more successful.\r\n                </small>\r\n              </Fade>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"container\">\r\n        <div className=\"row\" id=\"row\">\r\n          <h3 className=\"my-5\">Recent News</h3>\r\n          {admission &&\r\n            admission.map((item, idx) => (\r\n              <div className=\"col-md-4 col-sm-12\" key={idx} id=\"col-md-4\">\r\n                <div className=\"cardBlur my-3\">\r\n                  <div>\r\n                    <p className=\"headlineUrl\">Head Line</p>\r\n                    <p className=\"my-3 urlTitle\">\r\n                      <small>{item.title}</small>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <b>Read More &#x2193;</b>\r\n                    <p className=\"my-3\">\r\n                      <small>\r\n                        <a\r\n                          href={item.url}\r\n                          className=\"url\"\r\n                          target=\"_blank\"\r\n                          rel=\"noreferrer\"\r\n                        >\r\n                          {item.url}\r\n                        </a>\r\n                      </small>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <img\r\n                      className=\"urlToImg\"\r\n                      src={item.urlToImage}\r\n                      alt=\"img\"\r\n                      style={{ width: \"100%\", height: \"100%\" }}\r\n                    />\r\n                    <p className=\"urlDate my-3\">Date & Time</p>\r\n                    <p className=\"url\">\r\n                      <small>{item.publishedAt}</small>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            ))}\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Admission;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
